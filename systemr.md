Definitions:
- Data independence: immunity of applications to change in storage structure or access strategy (referring to the high-level, declarative SQL, decoupling of it to the implementation of the query operators etc)
- System catalog: description of the content and structure of the database / schema
- CPU bound: a program is CPU bound if it becomes faster when CPU becomes faster
- Consistent: A consistent state is one in which the database does not reflect any updates made by transactions which did not complete successfully
