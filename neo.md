### What is the problem being solved?

End-to-end query optimisation with deep reinforcement learning techniques.

### How was this problem solved previously?



### What is the main idea?



### What are the key results?



### What are the main limitations of this paper?



### Why did this paper have an impact?

I wonder if Neo is actually used? If not, why? It seems only to be a demonstration of ideas.


### Own Notes

- Traditional query optimiser: cardinalityh estimation, cost model, plan search algorithm
- QEP: query execution plan
