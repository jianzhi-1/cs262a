# Moore (1965)

### Strength and Weakness

Strength: It is a survey paper, so it's easily understandable and concise. Mainly it lists a number of predictions, touches upon several well-known trends in today's world (Moore's law, Dennard's scaling, physical limitation, and limitions to analog devices). Most importantly, it clarifies Moore's law as being "self-fulfilling", a wild "extrapolation", cost-driven, industry-driven, and engineering brilliance-driven. The paper decomposes the fabrication process and points out that there are multiple stages for optimisation.

Weakness: Well, it is a survey paper, so there is no new results. 

### Comments

I think the first lecture covers this paper in great details already. The main point is the U-shaped cost diagram which illustrates the economy of scale and fundamental technological limitations (Physics).

### Discussion Questions
- Has linear integrated circuits caught up yet? Or are they still limited by the sizes of inductors and capacitors?
